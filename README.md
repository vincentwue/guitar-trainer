# simple two layer guitar scale/chord visualizer

[Visit guitar trainer (hostet on github pages)](https://vincentwue.github.io/guitar-trainer/)

## History

I wanted to use some TypeScript and create my own guitar learn app.

You can choose a chord in the first dropdown and the scales that contain this chord will show up as buttons below. Click them to set the second layer.

You can enable "show second" to show the pattern choosed in the second dropdown as simple black dots (most useful for me at this point).

I do not need more functionality currently,
but you can see a lot of useful information in the console.

Text me if you're interested in further features (vini96@web.de)

## Possible next steps (Postponed until I see use for it)

Add missing chords and scales (I will add them when I want to learn them).

Allow interval symbols.

Allow sharp or flat symbol preference.

Redesign and create bigger UI concept.

Implement left handed support.

Allow multiple fretboards simultaneously.

Turn colors on/off (and make legend -> interval or note colors?).

Save UI state to localStorage.

Show triads and tetrads (and more) for scales.

Correct english/german naming.

Implement UI for more string instruments and different tunings.

## Hint

Check the console with F12 to see the data structure.

Most functionality is present already, but not implemented in the UI.

Life is short,
and art long.

Stay tuned. Music is love.
