# Guitar scale/chord visualizer

[Visit guitar trainer (hostet on github pages)](https://vincentwue.github.io/guitar-trainer/)

## History

You can visualize two patterns (scales/chords) in one view simultaneously.

You can invert them and copy a pattern two show two or more fretboards at the same time.

When a scale is selected, matching chords are selectable below (just try it).

When a chord is selected, matching scales are selectable below.

Text me if you're interested in further features (vini96@web.de).


## Possible next steps (Postponed until I see use for it)

Add missing chords and scales (I will add them when I want to learn them).

Allow interval symbols.

Allow sharp or flat symbol preference.

Redesign and create bigger UI concept.

Implement left handed support.

Allow multiple fretboards simultaneously. CHECK

Turn colors on/off (and make legend -> interval or note colors?).

Save UI state to localStorage. CHECK

Show triads and tetrads (and more) for scales. CHECK

Correct english/german naming.

Implement UI for more string instruments and different tunings.

## Hint

Press F12 to see the datastructure in the console.

Most functionality is present already, but not implemented in the UI.

Life is short,
and art long.

Stay tuned. Music is love.
