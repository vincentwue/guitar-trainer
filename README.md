# Small Guitar Trainer

I wanted to use some TypeScript and to create my own guitar learn app.

You can choose a chord in the first dropdown and the scales that contain this chord will show up as buttons.

You can enable "show second" to show the underlying scale as simple black dots (most useful for me at this point).

I do not need more functionality currently,
but you can see a lot of useful information in the console.

Text me if you're interested in further features.
